## Homework №1
#### HttpClient
`HttpClient` is used to send HTTP requests using the `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` methods.

#### OpenAiClient
`OpenAiClient` utilizes the capabilities of `HttpClient` and implements several auxiliary methods.

`OpenAiClient` methods:
`String getResponse (String prompt)` - the primary method for sending a request and receiving a response.

`String getOpenAiToken()` - a method for obtaining an API key to send requests to the OpenAI server. It must be stored in the `openai.properties` file in the project root in the `open.ai.token` variable

`String getTextFromJSON (JSONObject object)` - a method for parsing the response from the AI, based on the OpenAi documentation. Quote from the OpenAi documentation:
> The output array often has more than one item in it! It can contain tool calls, data about reasoning tokens generated by reasoning models, and other items. It is not safe to assume that the model's text output is present at output[0].content[0].text.

#### Main
This class conducts a small test of some `HttpClient` methods using the resource https://webhook.site, where you can easily track the requests and responses received.

To interact with the AI, a simple “chat” without context is implemented in a while loop.
